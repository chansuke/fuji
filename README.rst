What is MQTT Gateway
=====================

**This definition is Shiguredo original**

A MQTT gateway is a sensor-MQTT gateway which receives data from sensors and sends that data to a MQTT broker.

Architecture::

    <sensor> -> (BLE)     ->             +-------+
    <sensor> -> (EnOcean) -> (Serial) -> |Gateway| -> (MQTT) -> <MQTT Broker>
    <sensor> -> (USB)     ->             +-------+

fuji is a MQTT gateway which is written by Golang.
